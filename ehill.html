        <h3>
        Meet Emma
        </h3>
          I created this blog (<i>formerly named EJ Style</i>)
          <br>back in Octoberof 2008, although back then
          <br>it looked very different. I worked full
          time
          <br>as a retail manager and just felt that I needed
          <br>a creative outlet where I could express my style
          <br>and my opinions on Fashion among otherthings.
          <br>
          <br>This blog has always been my voice, my little corner of the
          internet
          <br>where I can share, inspire and connect with people all over
          the world.
          <br>In August 2013 I left my job in retail to pursue turning
          the blog into a fully fledged business.
          <br>I feel very fortunate to have
          had so many incredible experiences and opportunities
          <br>over the last 10
          years, from travelling around the world to working with so many of my
          favourite brands
          <br>and now running a successful business with my
          husband...
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
        <h3>Meet Simon
        </h3>
        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HGX_A61W3o0/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Simon" width="500" height="300"/>
        <br>Simon, aka ‘Employee of the Month’ and my husband,
          <br>left his full time job in the public sector
          <br>to become an equal partner of the business in June 2017.
          <br>Since then we have been able to expand our content to YouTube
          <br>and grow a Channel of over 187K subscribers amassing over
          <br>15 million views across our videos.
          <br>
          <br>In turn this grew our global audience across our other social channels
          <br>such as Instagram and also our readership of the blog by 62%
          <br>in the space of 18 months, and still climbing.
          <br>Simon is responsible for the photography, videography and editing (among other things)
          <br>that you see throughout our content and he is self taught in using a whole range of professional equipment
          from DSLR’s to drones and video/photo editing software.

          <h3>Why I don`t attend Fashion weeks</h3>
          <br>Another Fashion Month has begun but the only glimpse that I see is on my Instagram feed because as you
          might have noticed, I don't attend fashion weeks. About two years after starting my blog I attended my first
          London Fashion Week, I remember feeling so excited even though I had no idea what to expect. I still had a
          full time job so I was restricted to attending at the weekend and I didn't really know any other bloggers so
          my plan was just to rock up and see what it was all about. My mum had even offered to 'buy me tickets to some
          of the shows' and I would say that I laughed at this, but I didn't know how it worked either. Street Style
          (photography) hadn't really boomed into the phenomenon that it is today and so the atmosphere was a lot calmer
          than the years that followed. As I walked in to Somerset House I remember feeling so small and there were
          people everywhere, all huddled together in their cliques, dressed to impress...impress who I didn't know. I
          didn't go to any shows because of course I hadn't been invited, but I did go and 'register' which resulted in
          me wearing a laminated piece of paper on a lanyard around my neck for the whole day. This 'badge' allowed me
          to walk around the showrooms where brands were showcasing their latest collections on little foldaway tables,
          it was essentially a trade show. Nothing really happened, my eyes weren't particularly opened to anything but
          for some reason the atmosphere pulled me in.
          <br>A few seasons rolled by and I would attend every London Fashion Week for as many days as my job would
          allow. I began learning a bit more about the ins and outs of Fashion Week and it started becoming fun when it
          involved mingling with other bloggers, I was now stood in a boldly dressed clique. But as the number of
          bloggers began to rise the British Fashion Council started clamping down on who could register. Accreditation
          became a 'thing' and this was the first point at which I started feeling like there was a hierarchy. Although
          you didn't need to be an accredited blogger to be invited to the shows, that was still all down to the PR's of
          brands/designers, life did seem to appear sweeter by having that laminated badge which had been oh so easy to
          obtain in previous seasons. But alas accreditation was not on the cards for me and now that I'm older and
          wiser I can totally understand why from a BFC point of view, I just wasn't important enough.
          <br>Accepting that I would never be bestowed with the laminated badge again, a month before each season I
          would start working my way through the list of PR contacts for all the shows on the LFW schedule. I literally
          emailed every, single, one. And yes at first I did the old 'copy & paste' trick and just changed the contact
          name and brand name, and yes, I licked some serious arse by proclaiming my undying love for these huge luxury
          designers, designers that I'd never heard of and designers that literally only rear their overdressed heads
          during fashion week. Proclaiming an undying love for the likes of such powerhouses like Burberry when I
          couldn't even afford to buy a keyring let alone own anything else from their collections does fill me with a
          certain nostalgia, young naive Emma. I daren't think how many PR's who probably instantly hit the delete
          button when skimming through my emails but of course, I was never going to get a Burberry invite so why waste
          their time. I do remember feeling such a buzz when sending off hundreds of these pleading show tick requests,
          it was a hopeful buzz, a 'what if' buzz. All I wanted in life was a handful of show tickets.

          <h3>The Must-Have Skirt
          </h3>
          <br>There's a clear must-have item which has emerged recently...the leopard print skirt. Animal
            print in general is huge for this coming season (be warned) but the hero piece is a leopard skirt. The most
            sought after skirt was this one from Realisation Par which has sold out 3 times already (note: it is now
            back in stock and they ship internationally) but for those of you whose budgets can't quite stretch to the
            $180 price tag, or for those of you who simply don't want to spend that on a skirt fret not because the high
            street have quickly cottoned on to the trend. I'm wearing one from my favourite high street brand (or at
            least one my top 3 faves) & Other Stories and even this skirt has been getting some serious airtime over on
            Instagram, and it's not just me that loves it, many of my fellow bloggers are also donning this skirt so
            there's lots of outfit Inso out there to feast your eyes on. I have also listed some other affordable
            alternatives at the bottom of this post,
            <br>I know leopard print might be scary to some of you but it's actually a pretty versatile print. My rule
            of thumb when styling leopard print is to keep everything else simple, wear basics in block colours (no
            clashing prints) and black is always a fail safe "colour" to pair it with. Also don't put leopard print in
            the 'Going out-out' category, leopard print can be done casually too; team with a basic t-shirt or
            sweatshirt and a pair of trainers.
